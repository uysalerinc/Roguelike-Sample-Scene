# Roguelike-Sample Scene

Basic Sample scene for roguelike game inspired by Vampire Survivors with:

- All configurable wave-based gameplay.
- Auto-moving weapons
- Be able to add more weapons with Scriptable objects 

In this scene there is only one weapon, one enemy type, 2 short waves, no other scenes such as shop, but that would be added easily.
